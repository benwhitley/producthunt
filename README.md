## Digital Jersey Coding Programme

This repository contains a brief overview of each session run on the course along with links to relevant resources and completed code written by mentors during sessions.  If you're lucky you might find that some of the code has comments.

##### 1 - Introduction to software and the course

##### 2 - Taking the design of a simple dashboard page designed by Tom H and coding it up in HTML and CSS

Links to go here about DNS and how browsers render code

You can find my completed code in the 'Session 2' Folder.  Remember that the way i've done it is not necessarily going to be the right way, as there are many different ways to get to the same end result (something that looks the same).

##### 3 - Coding up the design of session 2

Reference Resources
* [MDN (Mozilla Developer Network)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/): Your one stop shop for when you need to know ALL information about a particular HTML tag or CSS selector
* [CSS-Tricks Almanac](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/): Well thought explanations of various CSS selectors etc by an industry specialist.  Check out his blog articles, videos and snippets as well
* [Can I Use?](http://caniuse.com/): Thinking of using a certain CSS selector or property? This site will let you know what browsers support it.

Session Specific Resources
* [All About Floats](https://css-tricks.com/all-about-floats/): You will use floats a lot when coding in HTML and CSS so it's good to know exactly how they behave and when to use them.
* [The Box Model](http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/box-sizing-secret-simple-css-layouts): A thorough understanding of this is necessary for a solid foundation in CSS.

##### 4 - Wrapping up HTML & CSS basics

Some interesting CSS and HTML related articles

* [Wtf HTML & CSS](http://wtfhtmlcss.com/) - Some common problems that you might encounter when starting out with HTML and CSS
* [HTML Crimes](http://line25.com/articles/10-html-tag-crimes-you-really-shouldnt-commit) - A relatively old article discussing some things to avoid doing
* [Dive into HTML5](http://diveintohtml5.info/semantics.html#new-elements) - A massive article on HTML5.  Perhaps just look at the small section discussing some of the new HTML5 elements and when to use them.
* [The Magic of CSS](http://adamschwartz.co/magic-of-css/) - A beautiful guide on some of the basics of CSS

Coding up another design
* You can find the design in Session 4.
* For the gallery, don't worry about using the images on the design. Instead, use a service such as [PlaceKitten](https://placekitten.com/) which will provide you with lovely placeholder images of kittens.
* For the icons, don't use images.  Instead use an icon font such as [FontAwesome](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/get-started/).   To use it just include a link to it in the head of your page (BootstrapCDN by MaxCDN method). Find out how to use the icons from the examples page.
* For the font, try using [Google Web Fonts](https://www.google.com/fonts) - Perhaps try using a font such as Lato.

##### 6 - Setting up a ruby development environment

* Windows: You'll have Robs fancy Ubuntu virtual machine installed on your PC
* Mac: We lead you through [this guide](http://railsapps.github.io/installrubyonrails-mac.html)

##### 7 - Intro to ruby

Matt's exercises can be found in the folder titled *Session 6-9*

Some sample solutions to the problem can also be found in this folder
